# Fibonacci Dynamic Programming

This project compares 2 dynamic programming ways to compute the n-th Fibonacci number:
- **Recursive with Memorization** (Top-Down)
- **Iterative with Memorization** (Bottom-Up)

### 1. Recursive + Memorization
- Uses recursion + a memo array.
- Avoids redundant calls.

### 2. Iterative Tabulation
- Uses a loop to fill values from 0 to n.
- No recursion.

## Performance
First method works faster than second.

# Factorial Dynamic Programming

This project compares 2 methods for calculatiing the factorial of n using:

- **Recursive with Memorization**
- **Iterative loop based approach**


### 1. Recursive + Memorization
- Top-down approach with caching.
- Avoids redundant computations.

### 2. Iterative
- Simple for loop from 2 to n
- No recursion or extra memory


### Performance
Second method works faster than first.
